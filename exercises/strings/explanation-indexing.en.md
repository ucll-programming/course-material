# Indexing

A string can be seen as a sequence of characters.
You can access each of these characters individually using indexing:

:::code{caption="Python Shell"}

```python
>>> string = "abc"
>>> string[0]
"a"

>>> string[1]
"b"

>>> string[2]
"c"
```

:::

::::IMPORTANT
Note that the indexing is *zero-based*, which means that the first element has index 0 and not 1.
