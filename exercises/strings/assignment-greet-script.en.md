# Greet Script

:::TASK
Turn the previous greet exercise into a runnable script.

* Create a file `greet.py`.
* Copy all relevant code from your previous solution.
* Add a `main` function.
* Call the `main` function at the top level, but only if the file is ran as a script.
* Add a shebang line at the top to inform the OS about how to launch this file.
* Launch the file and check that everything works as intended.
:::

:::INFO
Running your script by double clicking on it from the GUI will cause a new window to pop up.
Depending on your machine, this window might disappear immediately after the script is done.
Therefore, in order to see the output, you may want to add some code that causes the window to stick around for a little while more.

A few possible approaches:

* Rely on `input()`
* [`time.sleep`](https://realpython.com/python-sleep/#adding-a-python-sleep-call-with-timesleep)
* `os.system('pause')`
