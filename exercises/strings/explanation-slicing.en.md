# Slicing

Say you want the first three characters in a string:

:::code{caption="Python"}

```python
string = "abcdef"
first_three = string[0] + string[1] + string[2]
```

:::

While this code works, it is very cumbersome.
*Slicing* will make this process much simpler:

:::code{caption="Python"}

```python
string = "abcdef"
first_three = string[0:3]
```

:::

When indexing using something of the form `i:j`, you will get the substring that ranges from index `i` up to index `j`.

::::IMPORTANT
Note that the slice `string[i:j]` does *not* include the character at index `j`.
::::

There are a few variations on this syntax:

::::div{.formatted-table}
:::center

| Syntax | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `s[:j]` | Same as `s[0:j]` |
| `s[i:]` | Same as `s[i:len(s)]` |
| `s[:]` | Same as `s[0:len(s)]`, i.e., returns the whole string |

## Steps

It is also possible to specify a step: `s[start:end:step]`.

:::code{caption="Python Shell"}

```python
>>> "abcdefg"[::2]
"aceg"
```

:::

Negative steps allow you to reverse the substring:

:::code{caption="Python Shell"}

```python
>>> "abcd"[::-1]
"dcba"

>>> "abcdefg"[4:2:-1]
'ed'
```
