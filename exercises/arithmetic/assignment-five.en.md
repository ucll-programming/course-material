# Five

It's time for you to write your very own function!

Most exercises will have you write one or more functions.
You'll have to write these in a file `student.py` placed in the chapter's directory.

:::TASK

* Create a file `student.py` in this chapter's directory (`exercises/arithmetic`).
* In this file, write a function `five()` that returns `5`.
* Check your work by running the tests.
  * Either press this exercise's difficulty icon in the sidebar.
  * Or, run `pytest test-five.py` in the terminal.
    Make sure you're in this chapter's directory.
    You can use `pwd` to check.

::::HINT
As a reminder, this is how a function that returns `0` looks like:

:::code{caption="Python"}

```python
def zero():
    return 0
```
