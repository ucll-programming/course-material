# Relocating

If you downloaded the course material to a location you're not happy with, you can move it as follows:

* Move the course material directory structure to another location.
  Make sure to move it in its entirety: the top level directory should contain a `.git` subdirectory (it's hidden though, so you might have to ask your OS to show hidden files).
* Open a shell somewhere inside the course material.
* Type `progtool relocate`.
