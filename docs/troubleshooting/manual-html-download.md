# Downloading index.html Manually

If you merely need to update your `index.html` file, please follow [these instructions](../workflow/update-html.md).

The latest version of `index.html` can be found [here](https://github.com/ucll-programming/frontend/releases/latest).
Download the `index.html` file and store it somewhere.

Next, tell `progtool` about its location.
