# No Git Repository

If you were referred to this page by the assistant tool, it means the assistant tool was unable to find a Git repository.
This can be due to the following reasons:

* You didn't clone the repository, but merely downloaded it.
  Please follow the instructions as they are written.
* You're not running `progtool` while **inside** the course material repository.
  Do remember that when you clone a repository using `git clone URL course-material`, Git creates a **new subdirectory** named `course-material` in which it stores the data.
  You must be inside that directory.
  You can enter it using `cd course-material`.
