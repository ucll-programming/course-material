# Updating the Theme

You only need to read this page in case the lecturers actually refer you to it.
It describes how to receive updates of the styling (colors, layout, ...)

## Steps

You can view a list of available themes using the command

```bash
$ progtool theme list
```

To download a theme, enter

```bash
$ progtool theme download THEME
```

where `THEME` has been replaced by the theme's name, e.g., `default`.
