# Receiving Assistant Tool (progtool) Updates

You only need to read this page in case the lecturers actually refer you to it.
It describes how to receive updates to the assistant tool (e.g. bug fixes.)

## Steps

Make sure the tool is not running, i.e., not acting as a server.
If it is, use `CTRL+C` to shut it down.

Enter the following command:

```bash
$ pipx upgrade progtool
```
