In a shell (the directory is unimportant), enter the two commands shown below.

```bash
$ pipx ensurepath

$ pipx install git+https://github.com/ucll-programming/progtool
```

Close the current shell and open a **new shell** in the same directory in which you have downloaded the exercises.
Enter

```bash
# In a NEW shell, inside the course-material directory
$ progtool setup
```
