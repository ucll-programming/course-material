## Accepting the Assignment

On Toledo, under "Cursus Materiaal", you'll find a link to the GitHub Classroom Assignment.
Click on it.
You will be led to a page inviting you to "Accept this assignment".
Press the button to accept it.

You are then shown a page informing you that your repository is being prepared.
Refresh the page every few seconds until a new page appears telling you you're ready to go.
A URL should be shown: it should look something like `https://github.com/UCLL-P1-2324/p1-exercises-2324-yourusername`.
You will need this URL soon.

> If you go to your repository's website, GitHub tries to be helpful by showing you instructions of how to set up things, such as creating a `README.md` file.
> Do NOT follow these instructions.
> Only follow the instructions shown on this page.

> If you happen to lose the URL, simply visit the GitHub Classroom link on Toledo again.
> You'll be brought straight back to the page showing the URL.

## Cloning the Repository

On your machine, [**create a directory**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link troubleshooting/create-directory.md %}) where you would like to store the exercises.

> Do **not** place this directory under OneDrive/Dropbox/Google Drive/...
> We will be working with GitHub, which is a better alternative for storing code in the cloud.
> Storing a Git repository on OneDrive/... could corrupt it.

[**Open a shell in this directory**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link troubleshooting/open-shell.md %}) and enter the following command:

> As always, you only need to enter in commands following a `$`.
> All other lines are either comments or expected responses.

```bash
# Downloads the repository
# !!! Replace YOUR-FORK-URL by the URL you were given earlier by GitHub Classroom
$ git clone YOUR-FORK-URL course-material
```

You may be asked to enter your GitHub username and password in order to continue.

If you receive an error about password authentication, you will need to [generate a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
Then rerun the clone command above and use the resulting token in place of a password.

You should receive a notification that you have cloned an empty repository.
This is good, you'll fill up the repository with files in the next few steps.

You should notice a new directory named `course-material` has been created, but it is still empty.

## Setting Up Remote Repositories

Enter the following commands:

```bash
# Goes into course material directory
$ cd course-material

# Tells Git about the lecturer's repository and call it upstream
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ucll-programming/course-material.git
```

Let's check if everything worked:

```bash
# Asks for a list of remote repositories
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/UCLL-P1-2324/p1-exercises-2324-youraccountname (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/UCLL-P1-2324/p1-exercises-2324-youraccountname (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ucll-programming/course-material.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ucll-programming/course-material.git (push)
```

Here, `origin` refers to your very own repository, which you have write access to.
`upstream` refers to our repository, to which you only have readonly access.

## Getting the Course Material

```bash
# Downloads from lecturer's repository
$ git pull upstream master

# Switches from main to master branch
$ git checkout master

# Uploads to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin master
```

Visit your remote repository's webpage.
You can do this by using a browser and going to your repository URL.
It should show a listing of directories and files:

| Your repository's webpage |
| :----------------------: |
| ![Repository webpage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link installation/repo-webpage.png %}) |

It's probably not *exactly* the same, which is okay.
The goal is to make sure your repository is not empty.

From now on, you should make sure to always push your solutions to GitHub.
Instructions for how to do this can be found [here](../../workflow).
