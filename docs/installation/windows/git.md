# Git Installation (Windows)

> Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed before you install Git!

Downloading Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/download).
Next, launch the installation.

The installation setup consists of relatively many steps.
Below we highlight a few steps.
Not all of the installation steps are shown below: **if not shown below, you should simply accept the defaults**.

## Installation Path

We strongly advise you to install Git in the default location.
It is **not** a good idea (as some have done before) to install it in a OneDrive directory.

## Components

* Make sure Git Bash Here is checked.
* Make sure Add a Git Bash Profile to Windows Terminal is also checked.

## Default Editor

If Visual Studio Code is not listed, you should cancel the installation of Git and install Visual Studio Code first.

{% capture my_include %}{% include git-configuration.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}
