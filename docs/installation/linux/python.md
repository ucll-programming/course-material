# Python Installation (Linux)

How to install Python depends on your Linux distribution.
Look up how to install Python.
Make sure to install version 3.11 exactly (not even a more recent version!)

## Checking Your Python Installation

Open a shell in the `scripts` directory.

```bash
# Runs the check-python-installation.py script
$ python3 check-python-installation.py
```

If the output ends on `SUCCESS`, you can proceed with the [next step](python-packages.md).

> In all further instructions, we will just write `py` to run Python scripts, but you will have to remember to replace `py` by `python3`.

## Next Step

[Install Python packages](packages.md).
