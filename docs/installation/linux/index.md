# Installation Instructions (Linux)

> **Disclaimer** If you're using Linux, we will assume you possess a certain technical know-how.
> Our Linux instructions will be a bit vaguer than for other OSses, informing you only of *what* to do, not *how* to do it.
> Given the large number of Linux distributions, desktop environments, shells, etc. it is simply impossible for us to provide detailed instructions for Linux users.

For this course, you will need the following software:

* [Visual Studio Code](vscode.md) with extensions
* [Git](git.md)
* [Download the exercises](github-classroom.md)
* [Python 3.11 or better](python.md)
  * Install all [necessary packages](packages.md)
* [Install the assistant tool](progtool.md)

Be sure to click on the links: they're not simply links to where to download software, but contain actual instructions.
