# Python Installation (MacOS)

Python can be found [on the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Download version 3.11 (don't pick a more recent version!) and install it.
If need be, you can always look on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/36Uu4Gn_A3o?t=112) for extra help.

## Checking Your Python Installation

Open a shell in the `scripts` directory.

```bash
# Runs the check-python-installation.py script
$ python3 check-python-installation.py
```

If the output ends on `SUCCESS`, you can proceed with the [next step](python-packages.md).

> In all further instructions, we will just write `py` to run Python scripts, but you will have to remember to replace `py` by `python3`.

## Next Step

[Install Python packages](packages.md).
